        <h3>TEXT_ADVENTURE GAME</h3>
        <p>This is like my REAL first game. I added a graphic logo on the front of my game. I liked this idea about a TEXT_BASED game. At first I think that I was just thinking too professional. So I just narrowed it down to put in just one graphic.</p>
        <p>I added lots of room. I did a text adventure game. I had a hard time adding the time function but I got it to work. I made a game because I couldn't play games at home so I would do my program and play my game at the same time. This program was based on my school project.</p>
        <p>I added more rooms. I added a time function, I changed some bugs that were in the program such as Items. This was my first game, so I thought that my brother would think it was lame. BUT!!! THEY LOVED IT!! I was kind of shocked with their reactions. Soon they were like betting if they can get past the map in less that 40 seconds. This is my first game so some people might not like it but I enjoyed making it.</p>
        <p>And One more thing. You need those four things to run the program so download them then run it. THANKS!!</p>
